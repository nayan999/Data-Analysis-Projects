       "211  Yeah, and it took multiple things going wrong for that to happen.\\n\\nKlay was out, Steph, Draymond and Looney missed about 20 games each, Draymond had a poor year, Wiseman took longer to develop than they hoped, then was injured, they had a very hit and miss supporting cast etc.\\n\\nMy point is not that the Lakers are hopless. Quite the opposite really. It's just naive to think there was a single issue that caused last seasons under-performance.\\n\\nObviously they don't lack talent. It's both an issue of supporting cast, and not having everyone on the same page.   \n",

All-defensive team caliber defense every year. There isn’t a single team in the league that isn’t significantly better if it adds him. Even a team like Boston, with Marcus Smart there, gets a lot better with Beverly coming off the bench, because then at least one of them is always on the court plus he’s insurance against Smart getting hurt. Basically every other team gets a ton better.   \n",

       "628                                 Last season is still a season and is a good indicator of future trends considering his age. His athleticism covered up a lot of his flaws, but now that it's catching up to him he can't seem to change his approach and it's costing his team to the point that he's a negative asset that holds a distorted view of reality just based off his interviews and play. He can still contribute to a winning team IF he stops playing hero ball in the clutch and stops acting like a fucking turnstile on D. Even turnstiles give slight resistance ffs.   \n",

Idk I got the whole \"I love you but I ain't got to like you\" thing myself and I usually deserved it lol. Or \"I love you but I don't really like you right now\". Idk I feel like it's not the worst thing to teach your kids. Knowing that a close relationship whether it be platonic, familial, or romantic is gonna have some bumps from being around someone else so much but friction and temporary dislike doesn't mean there's not love. Actually did me a lot of good tbh looking back.   \n",

Annoying when he's playing your team, but the man has no letup and his will to win is huge.  Already a plus over hometown hero.   \n",

Realistically, the Lakers will be better, maybe good enough to stay out of the play in, but they can't touch the top 5 in the West. That's with Utah blown up and Mavs slightly worse off. 1. Warriors, 2. Denver, 3. Memphis, 4. Clippers, 5. Mavericks, 6. Lakers.   \n",
